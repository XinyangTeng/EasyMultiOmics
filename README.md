## EasyMultiOmics: An R package for comprehensive multi-omics data mining in systematic microbiome research

TaoWen Penghao Xie JunYuan et al



### Abstract

Advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology have significantly increased omics data, necessitating a shift from single-omics to multi-omics joint analysis to address systematic microbiome research requirements. However, tools that can comprehensively and efficiently perform multi-omics analysis are largely deficient. Here, we design and develop an R package EasyMultiOmics to solve this short slab. Built on the phyloseq class, EasyMultiOmics is a comprehensive tool to integrate statistical analysis, multi-omics analysis, and visualization . EasyMultiOmics contains over 300 functions and provides 14 workflows for single-omics data mining, including microbiome, metabolome, transcriptome, and metagenome analyses. For multi-omics joint analysis, it offers seven workflows that enable combined analysis of bacteria and fungi, composition and function of metagenome, microbiome and metabolome, transcriptome and metabolome, transcriptome and metagenome, as well as integrated analysis of four major omics (transcriptome, metabolome, metagenome, and microbiome). Compared to other multi-omics related tools, EasyMultiOmics is a fast, flexible, and modular, providing powerful and convenient tool for researchers.
