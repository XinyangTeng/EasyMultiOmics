\title{Reorder Significance Letters Based on Group Means}
\usage{
ord_sig(data, group_col = "group", letter_col = "groups", mean_col = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing group labels, means, and significance letters.}

\item{group_col}{The column name (as string) for the group identifiers (e.g., strain names).}

\item{letter_col}{The column name (as string) containing the significance letters (e.g., "a", "b", "bc", etc.).}

\item{mean_col}{The column name (as string) containing the group means.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with reordered significance letters
        (i.e., high-mean groups receive earlier letters like "a").
}
\description{
This function reorders group significance letters (e.g., from multiple comparisons)
according to descending order of group means, while preserving the original
significance grouping structure (i.e., groups that share a letter remain grouped).
}
\details{
This function is useful after statistical tests such as Tukey's HSD or Dunn's test,
where shared letters indicate non-significant differences between groups.
The function does not alter which groups are considered significantly different â€”
it only reassigns letter labels to reflect the relative magnitude of group means.

\examples{
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)

data <- data.frame(
  groups = c("c", "bc", "b", "a"),
  group = c("Rhi", "CK", "CF", "WT"),
  mean = c(243000, 58500, 46500, 43000),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

ord_sig(data)
